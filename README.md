## Part 1: original-guide.js
### Go to file with this [link](original-guide.js)
 The original program fades one led to another. Instead of a regular fade, the program waits until an led is fading at half light, then it starts lighting up the new led. The following link has the video of the origial program.

## Part 2: enable-matrix.js
### Go to file with this [link](enable-matrix.js)
The enable-matrix.js showcases that the led matrix and the leds work at the same time. The program lights up each individual led one at a time, then it lights up all three. When it lights  up all three external leds, it displays a firework pattern on the led matrix. The following link  has the video to this program.

## Part 3: twenty-eight.js
### Go to file with this [link](twenty-eight.js)
The twenty-eight.js project uses both the leds and the led matrix by using one of my old screensavers, called randomDots. This screensaver will randomly light either an external led or an led on the led matrix. The following link has a video to this program.

## Part 4: digital-in.js
### Go to file with this [link](digital-in.js)
The digital-in.js file is a program that turns on an LED when the TTL input button is set to one. When the button is not set 
to one, the LED is turned off. The following link has the video to the program.

## Part 5: manual-calibration.js
### Go to file with this [link](manual-calibration.js)
The manual-calibration.js file is a moisture meter. The sensor had to be manually calibrated before the program was downloaded. It then displays the amount of moisture by lighting up the corresponding led rows. The following link has the video to this program.

## Part 6: autocalibration.js
### Go to file with this [link](auto-calibration.js)
The auto-calibration.js is a moisture meter. The sensor asks for a reading in the air (it displays a downward arrow), then a reading in water (it displays an upward arrow). It will ask for three readings of air and water, then it will average the readings and use them to calibrate the sensor. It will then display the amount of moisture by lighting up the corresponding led rows. The following link has the video to this program.
